üôå I‚Äôm Geoff, an open source software engineer. I‚Äôm currently in Sydney, Australia. I‚Äôm observing [the AEST timezone](https://time.is/Sydney). Follow me on [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/geoffreyhuntley/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/geoffreyhuntley) and [YouTube](https://youtube.com/c/geoffreyhuntley) for chill tunes, #livecoding, office-hours, brownbags, pair-programming and maintaining software.

Instead of writing and maintaining software on my own I'm inviting you to pair-program with me in my office. Let's build software together. Be interactive, I love live suggestions, but please be kind and constructive. Live streaming can be scary. üíñ 

The stream schedule is maintained in [an online calendar you can subscribe to](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=Z2h1bnRsZXkuY29tX3BjNWo0MjdjZG1sNW81MmVqczE2aG91YmMwQGdyb3VwLmNhbGVuZGFyLmdvb2dsZS5jb20). Past stream recordings are on [my YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/c/geoffreyhuntley).

I currently work through a consultancy, but the opinions expressed publicly are my own and do not necessarily represent those of my clients unless otherwise stated. Do not quote me as ‚Äú$company person Geoffrey Huntley said‚Äù ‚Äì if I speak for a company, I will publish on its channels. This is my personal slice of the internet. Everything here is me and is my opinion.

# schedule

The stream schedule is maintained in [an online calendar you can subscribe to](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=Z2h1bnRsZXkuY29tX3BjNWo0MjdjZG1sNW81MmVqczE2aG91YmMwQGdyb3VwLmNhbGVuZGFyLmdvb2dsZS5jb20). Past stream recordings are on [my YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/c/geoffreyhuntley). When I'm not broadcasting you'll find me in the [discord](https://ghuntley.com/chat) chat. Please drop in and say howdy.

# contributing

There's a [contributing guide](https://github.com/ghuntley/live/CONTRIBUTING.md) that outlines how you can get involved. Let's build software together. Be interactive, I love live suggestions, but please be kind and constructive. Live streaming can be scary. üíñ 

# code of conduct

Please read the [Code of Conduct](CODEOFCONDUCT.md). As a project specifically setup to encourage folks to get involved further with open-source, I do not tolerate harassment of any kind directed towards myself, family or community members.

# support me

Please follow me on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/geoffreyhuntley) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/geoffreyhuntley). Tell your friends, as by doing so you'll help prove that there is demand for live coding on twitch and this activity worth doing. Twitch subs and bits are also greatly appreciated.

If you truly appreciate the work do on-air or in open source, please [buy me a cup coffee](https://www.patreon.com/ghuntley).  Things that take mental energy just work better with coffee!  I (almost always) brew my own coffee unless I'm in the city in which case you'll usually find me hanging out at [Espressory](https://www.espressory.com.au/). 

Anyway, thanks for any support you can offer if you decide to.


# inadvertent disclosure

I have multiple systems in place (multiple-monitors, broadcasting under an isolated operating system account, automated privacy screen switcher software, a physical production controlpad) to reduce the likely hood of accidentally disclosing secrets whilst on the air. That doesn't mean it won't  happen however. 

If you believe there has been inadvertent disclosure please get in [contact with me](mailto:ghuntley@ghuntley.com) immediately. I don't have the resources of [Google](https://www.google.com/about/appsecurity/reward-program/), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/whitehat) or [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/bug-bounty/) but at minimumn if you so desire, I'll put your name in the end of show hall of fame credits and send you some swag in the mail. Thank-you.

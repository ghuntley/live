# What went well?

- People turned up and they helped me code <3

    - async programming worked
    - Vats found a library for working with hue lights
    - Vats helped with postman 
    - Vats helped with finding types in the API surface
    - Met Mitch who has experience with discord and writing bots.
    - Mitch polished my discord channel to 11
    - Mitch created my bot "felicity" and shipped code to github.com/ghuntley/live

- Broadcasting to twitter is TOTALLY a good idea; had high quality people drop on in.
- Broadcasting to twitch seems to be the thing but the user interface of twitch is confusing to newbies. "how do they follow"
- Doing a run-sheet meant the first half of the show went well; the parts where a runsheet wasn't done or wasn't fleshed out is where it production wasn't as good. Need to create Kanban board and run off it. 

## What didn't go so well?

- Forgot to record on my local laptop so the only version I have is what was pushed online. Thus no 4K version. 
- Forgot to broadcast to Facebook Live.
- Video quality from cp920 isn't great, need to get better PTZ cameraa with optical zoom and improve room lighting.
- I'm out of USB ports, need to order powered hubs as pumping too much IO through existing buses.
- Control pad MIDI input switched from 1 to 2 and had to remap everything pre-show (what happened?!)
- Restream didn't connect to twitch; delaying broadcast for 15 minutes
- Broadcast latency is 10-20 seconds
- Fumbling around whilst coding due to nerves; silly stuff like not reading types properly.
- Master audio levels aren't good (too low?)
- 1.5hrs is too long; should have been able to do a tight 30min to 1hr show.
- Focus.
- forgot to thank people who helped with initial marketing
- forgot to advertise on /r/watchpeoplecode

## Any new tricks or ideas?

- advertise on /r/watchpeoplecode
- need to get visual studio live share enabled and spend a day familiarizing it.
- Use carnakeys so folks can see shortcuts used.
- need a pre-show checklist (i.e. like airplanes pilots use)
    - Audio levels at right db
    - Microphone

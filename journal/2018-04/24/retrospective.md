## What went well?

- audio levels were much better this time around
- folks helped out with vsts troubleshooting
- no major technical glitches

## What didn't go so well?

- first half of stream was on point, last section (11pm) wasn't tight due to 5am start this morning.

## Any new tricks or ideas?

- when setting title optimise for ating twitter usernames to maximise chances of reweets.
- always remember that folks can, do and will clip stuff out of context on twitch
- Use @code's terminal window and a command line IRC client + twitch IRC gateway. @ https://twitter.com/GeoffreyHuntley/status/1021897606824259585

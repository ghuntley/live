# What went well?

- Two streams in two different formats 

   a) "the retrospective of what's been learned and roadshow demo" - https://twitter.com/GeoffreyHuntley/status/1026410996775047168
   b) "let's triage open-source together" - https://twitter.com/GeoffreyHuntley/status/1026413749819691009
   
- Got retweeted by Jeff Fritz and had folks from visual studio twitch channel watching on in.
- Peak of 14ish viewers.
- The new USB hubs are working extremely well.
- Audio levels are getting better, now using a noisegate to remove background ambient noise.
- Wrapped up before I was tired.
- Auidence members asked how to get involved in opensource and provided them with suggestions to PR the polly project cause they use polly at work.

## What didn't go so well?

- Timeslot is too early, not enough audience in Australia yet. 10pm AEST is when viewership ramps up.
- LastPass is a source of inadvertant disclosure, need to disable autocomplete prompts and/or logout before going on air.
- There's not enough feedback provided that fadetoblack is enabled. Streaming was enabled (with fadetoblack active), f2b should roll end show credits, then fade2back, then wait 5 minutes, then terminate stream/local recording as a script.

## Any new tricks or ideas?

- LastPass is a source of inadvertant disclosure, need to disable autocomplete prompts and/or logout before going on air.
- Streaming was enabled (with fadetoblack active), f2b should roll end show credits, then fade2back, then wait 5 minutes, then terminate stream/local recording as a script.
- Create end of show credits so wrapping up isn't so abrupt

- People studying on Twitch is a thing (tm) - https://twitter.com/girlknowstech/status/1026472768513105925
- need to get visual studio live share enabled and spend a day familiarizing it.
- Use carnakeys so folks can see shortcuts used.
